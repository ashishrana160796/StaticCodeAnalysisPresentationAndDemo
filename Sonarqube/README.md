# SonarQube tool for generating analysis report

Below we provide some basic steps to get started with SonarQube server.

### SonarQube Setup

* Download Sonarqube server and runner. This helps us run our server from command prompt instead of gradle, maven etc.
* Setup environment variable for sonar-scanner. This helps us running commands from any location from the command prompt.
* Modify `conf` file sonar-scanner in the following below stated way.

```
#----- adding source code files to be analyzed
sonar.projectKey=SonarqubeDemo
sonar.projectName=SonarqubeDemo
sonar.projectVersion=1.0
sonar.sources=C:/Users/212703870/Desktop/StaticToolsCaseStudy/Sonarqube/EclipseDemoProject/SonarqubeDemo/src/com/sonarqube/test/MyFile.java (or directory specification)
```

* Run sonar-server file for the specific OS architecture, in Windows run it as administrator in cmd and use the below stated command.
```
sonar-scanner.bat -X
```
* Finally you can analyze the report generated by SonarQube. And again follow up, in case of any issues that are raised.


__Note:__
* Refer to [presentation](../StaticToolsComparativeAnalysis.pdf) for analysis of different code analysis tools.
